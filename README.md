# Capstone-Project_Loan-Default-Probability-Prediction
The goal of this project is to help X-Financial, a personal finance company, to predict long-term default probability of its clients at the time when they apply for a loan and help X-Financial control its credit risk.
The data includes applicants' demographic information, account information, inquiry history, mobile information and data provided by third-party organizations.
The dataset is slightly imbalanced, with a default rate of 15%.
